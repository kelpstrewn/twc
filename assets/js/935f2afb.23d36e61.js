This may be a contributing factor to the amnesia regarding the family history which was discussed elsewhere. Papers Past reveals that Josephine Curham appeared before the court  as did  John Curham. Josephine and John appear to have put this behind them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Difficult pasts/Marion Ruth Curham":{"id":"Difficult pasts/Marion Ruth Curham","title":"Marion Ruth Curham","description":"There is a painful side to the family history. Marian Ruth Curham died at the age of 19 in Freeman\'s Bay in Auckland in 1911, as a result of an accidental pregnancy and complications arising from an abortion outside the health system.  My siblings and I find this particular part of the family history particularly distressing. My brother has located Ruth\'s grave in Waikumete Cemetery and visits it occasionally.  It feels important to remember this tragic history that occurred at a time in a society that was very different from ours, and very hard on woman who became pregnant outside of wedlock.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Father and son":{"id":"Father and son","title":"Father and son","description":"This is partly a psycho-history, and partly a short family history. It is about two people of different temperaments and life experience, father and son, our sympathies and where we were unsympathetic. I hope to write unsentimentally and truthfully and imagine my audience to be my own children and perhaps other family who are part of this descent. Apart from myself, people who are still alive will not be named here.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Infrastructure/Gas works":{"id":"Infrastructure/Gas works","title":"Gas works","description":"A notable Curham, Robert Samuel, grew up in Curragh, Kildare, was apprenticed as a draper in Dublin, then was an artillery man, and then at sea in sail. Coming ashore, he married in Melbourne and was employed at the gas works. The use of coal gas for domestic lighting, cooking and heating was an emerging technology in the second half of the 19th Century, and was in competition with electricity into the 20th. R.S. Curham went on to run the works in Whanganui and in Port Chalmers.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Infrastructure/Liddle Construction":{"id":"Infrastructure/Liddle Construction","title":"Liddle Construction","description":"My mother\'s family also did infrastructure. My maternal great grandfather and his brothers built villa houses close to Eden Park, and the stone church at Paihia. My grandfather told stories of this project, he was a child at the time, and the extended family relocated to Paihia during construction.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Military/American Civil War":{"id":"Military/American Civil War","title":"American Civil War","description":"Robert Samuel Curham  enlisted into the 13th New York Heavy Artillery Regiment, Company \u201cB\u201d on August 29, 1863 fighting under under General Ulysses S.

He began as a rifleman, and became a warrant officer, as he was available to organise the logistics for the activities of his unit, which occurred during school holidays. My recollection is that this was an Auckland battalion, which no longer exists. He was eventually commissioned as Lieutenant.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Sectarianism":{"id":"Sectarianism","title":"Sectarianism","description":"Religion is a strong factor in New Zealand history and in New Zealand family history. I recall shortly after I met my future wife, Ellie, taking her and her daughter, my stepdaughter Emma, to meet  my maternal grandparents.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Thomas William Curham/At play":{"id":"Thomas William Curham/At play","title":"At play","description":"As a child, visiting my grandmother we sat in her small lounge , a formal room, not for everyday use. The room was dark and had lace curtains that were always drawn, as glare caused my grandmother discomfit. We played parlour games and cards in an atmosphere of formality. My grandmother had very old empire annual type books which we were allowed to read while the adults talked and took tea. All this was unusual in 1960\'s and 70\'s New Zealand, and in stark contrast to our visits to my maternal grandparents.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Thomas William Curham/At work":{"id":"Thomas William Curham/At work","title":"At work","description":"My father Tom attended university when he came back from the rural part of his primary school teaching career. His specialist subject was geography. He was mostly at university part time and  had one or two full time years. He enjoyed his time at university and often told stories of his flat in Devonport.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Thomas William Curham/Father":{"id":"Thomas William Curham/Father","title":"Father","description":"My grandfather, Tom\'s father was Robert Charles Curham. He was the youngest son of six, three boys and three girls. They lived in Thames. Robert was named after his father and uncle. His father Charles Curham died at 53 in 1906. Robert Charles was known as Charlie. He worked as a bushman clearing the Kaihikatea forests of the Hauraki Plains. He joined the  army in 1915 and was a mounted rifle in Egypt, Palestine and Syria.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Thomas William Curham/Grandfather":{"id":"Thomas William Curham/Grandfather","title":"Grandfather","description":"My great grandfather, Charles Robert Curham\xa0was born in\xa01851, in\xa0Kildare. His parents were Robert Curham and Mary Anne Curham nee Darker. There were two siblings,  Robert Samuel Curham and Margaret Elizabeth Curham. Margaret was married in Melbourne in 1865 to James Michael Kilfedder. It seems that there is truth in what my father told me, that the family left Ireland due to impoverishment in the countryside, with family members going first to the United States, on to  Victoria, and then to the west coast of New Zealand, in search of gold.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Thomas William Curham/Grandmother, uncles and aunts":{"id":"Thomas William Curham/Grandmother, uncles and aunts","title":"Grandmother, uncles and aunts","description":"Grandmother","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Thomas William Curham/Mother":{"id":"Thomas William Curham/Mother","title":"Mother","description":"My father\'s mother was Marion Elsie Vant. She was born in 1897 at Portsea Island. Her parents were John and Elizabeth Vant. The information below is partly taken from research by others using one name archival searches. It is in accordance with what I knew of my grandmother. I knew my grandmother as a child, and had the opportunity to carry that relationship forward in my teenage years and early twenties, but didn\'t. Now, in later life I regret this. My grandmother was a fine courageous women.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
