My dutiful parents felt that I should engage with the newly appointed careers guidance councillor, Mrs Geary, to plan ahead. Mrs Geary, in retrospect, must have been appointed because she was particularly eccentric and no longer suitable for classroom duties.

"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"In moderation the counteractive strategy is fine. Taken to an extreme it can result in an unreasonable striving for superiority, a tendency to aggression, and a need to be revenged. Criminal behaviours can result.
