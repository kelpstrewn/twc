It is in accordance with what I knew of my grandmother. I knew my grandmother as a child, and had the opportunity to carry that relationship forward in my teenage years and early twenties, but didn\'t. Now, in later life I regret this.

The room was dark and had lace curtains that were always drawn, as glare caused my grandmother discomfit. We played parlour games and cards in an atmosphere of formality. My grandmother had very old empire annual type books which we were allowed to read while the adults talked and took tea. All this was unusual in 1960\'s and 70\'s New Zealand, and in stark contrast to our visits to my maternal grandparents.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"01 Thomas William Curham/Grandfather":{"id":"01 Thomas William Curham/Grandfather","title":"Grandfather","description":"My great grandfather, Charles Robert Curham\xa0was born in\xa01851, in\xa0Kildare. His parents were Robert Curham and Mary Anne Curham nee Darker. There were two siblings,  Robert Samuel Curham and Margaret Elizabeth Curham. Margaret was married in Melbourne in 1865 to James Michael Kilfedder.

He ws eventually commissioned as Lieutenant.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"04 Difficult pasts/Curham in the courts":{"id":"04 Difficult pasts/Curham in the courts","title":"Curham in the courts","description":"Difficult parts of the family history include troubles with the law experienced by my grandfather\'s brothers and sisters. This may be a contributing factor to the amnesia regarding the family history which was discussed elsewhere. Papers Past reveals that Josephine Curham appeared before the court  as did  John Curham. Josephine and John appear to have put this behind them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"04 Difficult pasts/Marion Ruth Curham":{"id":"04 Difficult pasts/Marion Ruth Curham","title":"Marion Ruth Curham","description":"There is a painful side to the family history. Marian Ruth Curham died at the age of 19 in Freeman\'s Bay in Auckland in 1911, as a result of an accidental pregnancy and complications arising from an abortion outside the health system.  My siblings and I find this particular part of the family history particularly distressing. My brother has located Ruth\'s grave in Waikumete Cemetery and visits it occasionally.  It feels important to remember this tragic history that occurred at a time in a society that was very different from ours, and very hard on woman who became pregnant outside of wedlock.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"04 Difficult pasts/Sectarianism":{"id":"04 Difficult pasts/Sectarianism","title":"Sectarianism","description":"Religion is a strong factor in New Zealand history and in New Zealand family history.

It is about two people of different temperaments and life experience, father and son, our sympathies and where we were unsympathetic. I hope to write unsentimentally and truthfully and imagine my audience to be my own children and perhaps other family who are part of this descent. Apart from myself, people who are still alive will not be named here.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"unimportant notes/docs as landing":{"id":"unimportant notes/docs as landing","title":"docs as landing","description":"1.
