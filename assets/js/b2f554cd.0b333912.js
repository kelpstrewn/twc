It is historical, as due to time constraints I am not keeping bees at present. \\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n## Use wood\\nThis is because of a number of overlapping concerns. \\nI was using all wood components in my hives, no plastic. \\n\\n* In the long term I am interested in doing my beekeeping to the Demeter organic standard. \\n* I like working with wood. \\n* Having burnt hives, wood is less polluting and intrusive than burning plastic. Hives are required to burnt, by law, in New Zealand, if AFB is discovered.\\n\\nAs part of that process I had to reacquaint myself with the sizes of the various components that make up a hive. I found that there was not much information available online for standard New Zealand langstroth hives and that a previous source at the Wellington Bee Club website is no longer available online. \\n\\nFor this reason I decided to document the sizes and the process I took and put it online.\\n## Tools and process\\nIt is important to realise at the outset that making your own hardware from scratch is quite labour-intensive and can\'t really be justified in terms of an acceptable hourly rate for actually just doing your day job as against the money saved by making your own hiveware. \\n\\nThat said it does provide the opportunity to reuse and recycle materials in a sustainable manner. I found that the work is quite satisfying. \\n\\nA number of tools are required to do the work:-\\n\\n* Rulers\\n* Setsquare\\n* Vise or clamps\\n* A table saw\\n* A handsaw\\n* A sharp chisel\\n\\nThe table saw is perhaps the most important. There is quite a lot of ripping and cross cutting to size of timber in the process. \\n\\nThis also means that a location for your saw where neighbours are not going to be sensitive to noise is important. If you don\'t have these things then I suggest that you buy pre cut components.  \\n## Pre cut\\nHere are sources for standard NZ langstroth hive components. \\n\\n[Alliance](http://beeswax.co.nz/alliance-beekeepers-woodware/)\\n\\n[Tunicliffes](http://www.tunnicliffes.co.nz/bee-woodware-.html)\\n\\nIf you do decide to go ahead and make your own the next step is knowing what you are going to make. Here is the rough drawing I used. This was derived from the measurements given in Practical Beekeeping in New Zealand. \\n\\n![hiveware](roughboxsketch1.jpg)\\n\\n## Frame and box geometry\\nI made amendments to the frame geometry to make the most efficient use of the timber I had on hand. This was American Ash timber slats which were recycled from rejected components of a tram building project that I am involved with. Very sadly, Ash is available because of [Emerald Ash Borer](https://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/wood-blogs/industrial-woodworker/production-industry-guest-blogs/As-Chestnut-Goes-Ash-Follows-a-Hundred-Years-Later-227585851.html).\\n\\nArguably, it is the outside dimensions of the frames that count and if you use thicker sections than would be provided by commercial hiveware suppliers it is unlikely to make any difference to the bees, as long as a 6-8mm beespace is maintained. \\n\\nHere are some drawings with dimensions. \\n![hiveware](frame.png)\\n\\n![hiveware](frame1.png)\\n\\n\\n## Tables of standard dimensions\\n\\nHive box plan dimensions | Dimension in mm\\n-----------------|---------------------------------\\nTimber thickness | 20 (optional, the internal dimension is the important one)\\nOuter dimensions | 505 x 405 (make larger if thicker timber is used)\\nInner dimensions | 465 x 365\\n\\nHive box depths | Dimension in mm\\n-----------------|---------------------------------\\nFull depth | 240 \\nThree-quarter depth| 185 \\nHalf depth | 133 \\n\\nFrame holder (long side of box)| Dimension in mm\\n-----------------|---------------------------------\\nRebate depth | 13\\nledge | 10\\n\\nFrame geometry | box | box| box \\n-----------------|---------------|---|----\\nItem | full depth | three quarter depth | half depth\\nTop bar | mm | mm | mm \\nlength | 482 | 482 | 482 \\nwidth| 25| 25| 25 \\nthickness| 16 | 16 | 16 \\nlug depth | mm | mm | mm \\n(at point of contact) | 10 | 10 | 10 \\nBottom bar | mm | mm | mm \\nlength | 450 | 450 | 450 |\\nwidth (with rebate in bar, can leave out rebate, if so make thinner) | 25 | 25 | 25 |\\nthickness | 10 | 10 | 10 |\\nEnd bar | mm | mm | mm \\nlength | 230 | 175 | 123 |\\nwidth | 33 | 33 | 33 |\\nthickness (mine are 20mm) | 10 | 10 | 10 |\\n\\n\\n## Making \\nI made use of simplified geometry for the top and bottom bars. I ripped them to profile and then used a hand saw to cut them to length and check out the ends of the top bars. This can also be done on a table saw and the use of an [dado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dado_set) set of blades will make it even more efficient. \\n\\nThe end bars have more complex geometry. In my case I decided to leave them at the 20 mm thickness of the ash slats. \\n\\nThe same kind of thinking applies to sizing your boxes, except for boxes it is the internal dimension that matters not the external. You can use larger sections of timber and just make the boxes bigger externally, as long as internal size and ledge geometry remains correct.\\n\\nHere are a sequence of images, giving some hints as to process, working back from the finished item.\\n![hiveware](wholebox.png)\\n\\nAssembled box and frames.\\n\\n![hiveware](box1.png)\\n\\nBox, rebate short end for ledge and rebated corner.\\n\\n![hiveware](box2.png)\\n\\nBox, ledge geometry.\\n\\n![hiveware](box3.png)\\n\\nAssembled box.\\n\\n![hiveware](framedwg1.png)\\nAssembled frame.\\n![hiveware](framedwg2.png)\\n\\nExploded view of frame.\\n\\n![hiveware](beeshiveware02.jpg)\\n\\nA finished frame.\\n\\n![hiveware](beeshiveware02.jpg)\\n\\nFrame before hot wire applied to wax. I didn\'t cut grooves into the top and bottom bar, but used off cut wax to hold in place. A groove is better. Also I used three wire runs here, four is better.\\n\\n![hiveware](beeshiveware03.jpg)\\n\\nWax sheets need to be trimmed if the bar geometries are varied as I have done.\\n\\n![hiveware](beeshiveware04.jpg)\\n\\nHere are the hives that were burned, made from recycled pallet timber.

A learned article is [here](https://philarchive.org/archive/CAWEAT-4)\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n## Omphalos Theory\\nThe Theory was developed in support of a biblical instant of creation, to refute Darwin\'s evolution. The Theory is that Adam was created with a navel. He didn\'t need a navel as he was created not born. This was extended to include all of nature. Natural objects must be created with a history, or at least with the appearance of one. A natural object can\'t be a natural object without an apparent history. A tree would not be a tree without rings, which indicate its age, and even a newly created tree must have rings.\\n\\n![](Albrecht_D\xfcrer,_Adam_and_Eve,_1504,_Engraving-1.webp)\\n*Adam and Eve have navels, but never had umbilical cords.\\n\\n*The whole organisation of the creature thus newly called into existence, looks back to the course of an endless circle in the past. Its whole structure displays a series of developments, which as distinctly witness to former conditions as do those which are presented in the cow, the butterfly, and the fern, of the present day. But what former conditions? The conditions thus witnessed unto, as being necessarily implied in the present organisation, were non-existent; the history was a perfect blank till the moment of creation. The past conditions or stages of existence in question, can indeed be as triumphantly inferred by legitimate deduction from the present, as can those of our cow or butterfly; they rest on the very same evidences; they are identically the same in every respect, except in this one, that they were unreal. They exist only in their results; they are effects which never had causes. Perhaps it may help to clear my argument if I divide the past developments of organic life, which are necessarily, or at least legitimately, inferrible from present phenomena, into two categories, separated by the violent act of creation. Those unreal developments whose apparent results are seen in the organism at the moment of its creation, I will call prochronic, because time was not an element in them; while those which have subsisted since creation, and have had actual existence, I will distinguish as diachronic, as occurring during time. Now, again I repeat, there is no imaginable difference to sense between the prochronic and diachronic development...*\\n\\n## Recovered memory syndrome\\nBeing history minded I have enjoyed taking this a step further, and outside of the biblical realm. If natural objects can include unreal evidence of histories that were a perfect blank till the moment of creation, then so can memory. It is possible that we and that all we see, experience and remember were created in an instant a week ago, an hour ago, or a minute ago, by an unknowable all powerful god. What we remember of our lives was created at the same time as our bodies and all of nature were, and is unreal.\\n\\nThe theory is not able to be refuted by scientific method as it is a closed circle, and if believed, a matter of faith. I am drawn to this. It allows for a respect for the historical, but also for a skepticism towards it. This can be extended to other history related projects such as heritage, and the politics of identity.\\n\\n![](naturalistsrambl00goss_0419.webp)\\n*Sea creatures drawn by P.H.Gosse\\n\\n## Russell, Borges\\n*Bertrand Russell\u2019s reductio ad absurdum of the omphalos hypothesis, in The Analysis of Mind (1921), was that the world might just as well have been created five minutes ago, our memories and all. Jorge Luis Borges discussed this in his 1941 essay \u201cThe Creation and P H Gosse\u201d and alluded to it in his short story Tl\xf6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius (1941), in which he wrote that \u201cone of the schools of philosophy on Tl\xf6n goes so far as to deny the existence of time; it argues that the present is undefined and indefinite, the future has no reality except as present hope, and the past has no reality except as present recollection.\u201d\\n [Blog on navels](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2015/10/02/jeffrey-aronson-when-i-use-a-word-adams-navel/)"},{"id":"/2023/06/01/p04/race","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/06/01/p04/race","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/p04/2023-06-01-race.md","source":"@site/blog/p04/2023-06-01-race.md","title":"A yacht race on the Waitemata","description":"This one is aboy a shared family interest in racing sailboats.

TWC crewed for Peter Smith on Moana. \\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\nRichmond winter series non spinnaker. \\n## The Boat ##\\nThere were two mrx class boats in the race\\n\\n![](race01.jpg)\\n\\n Relaxed looking crews! The weather forecast had been under constant revision the last few days. Four days previous it was fresh, 20 knots plus. The front seems to have gone through early. Actuality is soft conditions, 3 to 10 knots from the Northwest ,warm and pleasant. \\n On our boat the pre race talk was on lightness. Skipper and owner Colin mentioned ocean racing practice, one cassette tape and one paper back book on each round the world leg for each crew. We are not yet that extreme but do take all sails that will not be used off the boat. The Mrx is already minimal inside, a stripped out race version of the farr 1020.  \\n\\n![yachting](race02.jpg)\\n\\n    Photo of start BMW cup a few years ago. Club marine is fourth boat down the line. \\n\\n## The Start ##\\nThe start sequence is one of the rituals of boat racing. A few more years ago I went to speedway several times with my teenage son and his friends. This shares a flag sequence and countdown type start. In this series our division starts first, which is nice because we get to lead the fleet down the harbour, until the bigger,faster boats with spinnakers catch us. \\n\\n![yachting](race03.jpg)\\n\\nThat day tidal flows was an issue. There was a spring high tide a couple of hours before our start, 3.5M variation high to low, which leads to rapid water movement as the harbour empties out. \\n## The course. ##\\n\\n![yachting](race03a.svg) \\n\\nFor our start because the tidal flow and wind are in the same direction, toward the start line, it is very easy to be over the line, and a boat that is too close will be short of options. We hung to the left of the pin pre start, and went for the pin on starboard tack. We had about two boat lengths of room when the hooter sounded, with good speed on. This put us at the front, just, once things had settled a couple of minutes after the start. Down the harbour there were streaks of pressure, and being in the middle in the area of maximum tidal flow was important. We poled our genoa very shortly after the start and gybed by Torpedo Bay. \\n\\n![yachting](race04.jpg)\\nWe lead! .... for a while. \\n\\n## Down wind to flax point ##\\nOnce set up there was little for the crew to do, except to enjoy the scenery and look for extra pressure. We had five of us on the boat, four from <a href=\\"http://www.sailptchev.org.nz/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Point Chev Sailing Club</a>, which is dinghies rather than keelers. \\n\\nWe were looking for hints re wind speed; are boats elsewhere going faster and more powered up , and is there change to texture on the surface of the sea? Less glass more ruffle means more wind. A day like this is interesting, if one brings the right frame of mind. Big tide, varying wind strengths and directions make this an intellectual challenge rather than a physical one. \\n\\nSo enough theorising, here you see a group of spinnaker boats and one from our division about to get on our wind. \\n\\n![yachting](race06.jpg) \\n\\nThe position of these boats forced us closer into the lee of North Head than we would have liked. Two boats in our division, Road Runner and Extract Digit, went much wider and came out better. The tide in the channel remained extreme, and we sailed at the mark but were taken well past it by the tide, and so sailed further. \\n\\n![yachting](race07.jpg) \\nFlax point is close to Rangitoto\\n\\n## Flax Point to Orakei ##\\nThe next mark was Orakei, and Colin got this leg right, staying low to get out of the tide early, and then going hard on the wind at the right time to lay. \\n\\n![yachting](race08.jpg) \\n\\nWe rounded with one boat, the digit, in front. Then to resolution bouy, this involved multiple short tacks, as the rest of the race would, to stay out of the tidal flow as much as possible. Again, this was about good helm, Colin picked the shifts better than the digit and we were through them.\\n\\n![yachting](race09.jpg) \\nTacking duel\\n\\n## Tidal Gates ##\\n\\nThere have been a series of reclaimations adjacent the wharf area, narrowing the harbour. Today the effect of this was marked, there was a tidal gate beside the wharf, that meant many short tacks and very slow progress to get through. \\n\\n![yachting](race10.jpg) \\n\\nThe fleet compressed, but the reality was that 300 metres up wind could represent 5 or 10 minutes in time because of the gate. \\n\\n![](race11.jpg)  \\nA ship appeared, luckily before we got to the container wharves.\\n\\nAt this point our nearest competition decided to head to the other side of the harbour to try their luck. We decided not to cover, the judgement being that getting over would be too long in the area of maximum flow, and that there would not be significantly more wind over there. So now, just head for the finish as quickly as possible, and hope we had it right. \\n\\n## Infrastructure ##\\n\\nThe series of photos is of wharf infrastructure. The port is the main determinant of the historical geography of Auckland. Also it looks good in the low winter light.\\n\\n![](race12.jpg) ![](race13.jpg) ![](race14.jpg) ![](race15.jpg)\\n\\nHeading for Westhaven the main challenge was to avoid damaging tacking duels with boats in other divisions. Here is a mini transat, racing in another division.\\n\\n![](race16.jpg)\\n## The end ##\\nApproaching the finish, the race had been on for more than 3 hours. How have we come out against the boats that crossed the harbour? Ok, as it turned out."}]}')}}]);
