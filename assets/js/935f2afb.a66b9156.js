The room was dark and had lace curtains that were always drawn, as glare caused my grandmother discomfit. We played parlour games and cards in an atmosphere of formality. My grandmother had very old empire annual type books which we were allowed to read while the adults talked and took tea. All this was unusual in 1960\'s and 70\'s New Zealand, and in stark contrast to our visits to my maternal grandparents.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"twc/At work":{"id":"twc/At work","title":"At work","description":"My father Tom attended university when he came back from the rural part of his primary school teaching career.
